    This capstone aims to understand the relationships between the independent variables such as: lack of sleep, lack of emotional support, and income and their influences on alcohol usage. Whether all three factors heavily influence alcohol usage will be examined as well as the individual relationships between the variables. It will be interesting to examine if lack of emotional support and low income are highly related and therefore influence alcohol usage. 

    According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC, 2021), excessive alcohol usage causes over 178,000 deaths annually. This includes fatalities from conditions such as liver disease and various cancers, including breast cancer in women, colon cancer, liver cancer, and oral cavity cancer. Alcohol use is also associated with heart diseases like hypertension, stroke, and coronary heart illnesses. Additionally, it is a leading factor in more than 15,000 motor vehicle traffic crashes each year. 

	Numerous factors contribute to alcohol use. Stress, a common part of life, triggers changes in bodily systems, with prolonged chronic stress causing significant harm (Rasheed, 2016). Lack of sleep (Blackwelder et al, 2021), lack of emotional support (Dvorak et al, 2014), and low income (Karriker-Jaffe et al, 2013) are a small number of factors that are often tied to chronic stress that may induce alcohol usage. 

	As Blackwelder and colleagues (2021) found, lack of sleep was defined as less than 6 hours per night with self-reported findings of mental health statuses as “not good” over a 2-week period. Lack of sleep is just as dangerous as being under the influence of alcohol as response times, ability to deal with daily demands, and cognition are at a deficit.

	Lacking emotional support causes a person to feel quite alone and isolated from a high-demanding world. Social resources differ for those in different income brackets, and oftentimes, low income groups lack support all around. It has been found that women in poverty who lack social support as under high stress tend to use alcohol as a means to manage stress (Moos et al, 1989; Johnson & Jennison, 1994; McCreary & Sadava, 2000; Piece et al, 1996).
